## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to something with election results from either 2016, 2018, 2020, or 2024. I don't know exactly what I would explore, it all depends on what data I can find. If I could find data from a statewide election in Michigan, that would be what I would want to do. But I'm unsure of what exactly.
